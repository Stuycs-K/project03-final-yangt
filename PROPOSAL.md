# Final Project Proposal

# Intentions:

Similar to the essay "game", I'd like to make sort of a texting through terminal thing. Users can send and receive messages in real-time through a command-line interface. The user will interact with the system by typing commands to send and receive messages. It will simulate a chat system that operates entirely through the terminal.
    
# Intended usage:

The user will interact with the program through a command-line interface. They will be able to:

Start the program as "user"
Send messages to a specified user or group. (updates and displays last X lines of a file)
Receive messages in real-time.
  
# Technical Details:

Networking: client-server communication 
Data structures: to represent users, messages, and server states. Arrays and linked lists may be used to manage messages and user data.
Concurrency: Threading to allow multiple users to send and receive messages concurrently.
File I/O: May store messages in log files to keep a history of conversations, which could be loaded when the program starts/'ran
    
# Intended pacing:
